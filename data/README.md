# Broadband Capstone Data Guide

## Data Sources
| Data Name | Description |
| --- | ---- | 
| [BroadbandNow Open-Data](https://github.com/BroadbandNow/Open-Data) | Zipcode Competition & Pricing Data |
| [US Broadband Usage Percentages Dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/USBroadbandUsagePercentages) | Estimated broadband usage rates by zipcode |
| [Assorted Statistics pulled from ACS/Census](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) | Assorted economic and demographic statistics by census tract pulled from 2019 ACS-5 using the Census API. |
|[Missouri Census Data Center Geocorr](https://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr2018.html)| A tool used to generate a dataset mapping zipcodes to US Census tracts. The columns afact & afact2 were generated using weighting of the 2010 census population. afact is the proportion of the source (zipcode) in the target (census tract). afact2 is the proportion of the target (census tract) in the source (zipcode).|
|[Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes.aspx)| Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes for each zip code|
|[EBB Program Data](https://www.usac.org/about/emergency-broadband-benefit-program/emergency-broadband-benefit-program-enrollments-and-claims-tracker/) | Total enrolled households in the EBB program by zipcode |

## Overview of Data Columns

The table below is a brief overview of the data columns found in the final dataset: [weighted_merged_all.csv](https://github.com/jcweaver/broadband-capstone/blob/main/data/weighted_merged_all.csv)
