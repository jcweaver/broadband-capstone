# Broadband Capstone Data Guide

## Data Sources
| Data Name | Description |
| --- | ---- | 
| [BroadbandNow Open-Data](https://github.com/BroadbandNow/Open-Data) | Zipcode Competition & Pricing Data |
| [US Broadband Usage Percentages Dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/USBroadbandUsagePercentages) | Estimated broadband usage rates by zipcode |
| [Assorted Statistics pulled from ACS/Census](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) | Assorted economic and demographic statistics by census tract pulled from 2019 ACS-5 using the Census API. |
|[Missouri Census Data Center Geocorr](https://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr2018.html)| A tool used to generate a dataset mapping zipcodes to US Census tracts. The columns afact & afact2 were generated using weighting of the 2010 census population. afact is the proportion of the source (zipcode) in the target (census tract). afact2 is the proportion of the target (census tract) in the source (zipcode).|
|[Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes.aspx)| Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes for each zip code|
|[EBB Program Data](https://www.usac.org/about/emergency-broadband-benefit-program/emergency-broadband-benefit-program-enrollments-and-claims-tracker/) | Total enrolled households in the EBB program by zipcode |

## Data Files

| File Name | Description |

| zip_conversion_data/ | Files generated using the [Missouri Census Data Center Geocorr](https://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr2018.html) to map zipcodes to US census tracts using 2010 Census population weighting|
| census_data.csv | Data collected using code written in [census_scripts/](https://github.com/jcweaver/broadband-capstone/tree/main/census_scripts) to pull the Census  API. |
| merged_broadband.csv | Dataset containing all of the broadband datasets in one generated by running the [eda.ipynb](https://github.com/jcweaver/broadband-capstone/blob/main/notebooks/eda.ipynb). |
| merged_census_broadband.csv | Interim dataset that merged broadband data to Census data using county codes. Generated from [census_broadband_merge.ipynb](https://github.com/jcweaver/broadband-capstone/blob/main/notebooks/census_broadband_merge.ipynb) |
| relabeled_census.csv | census_data.csv cleaned up to calculate different statistics and re-labelled with user friendly strings.  Generated from [census_data_cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/jcweaver/broadband-capstone/blob/main/notebooks/census_data_cleaning.ipynb)  |
| weighted_merged_all.csv | Final/recommended dataset to use for the project. This dataset merged the broadband data with the census data by tract, appropriately weighting tracts by the afact column.  Generated from [census_broadband_merge-copy.ipynb](https://github.com/jcweaver/broadband-capstone/blob/main/notebooks/census_broadband_merge-copy.ipynb)  |
